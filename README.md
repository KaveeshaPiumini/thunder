    cd thunder-<version>-<os>-<arch>/
    ```

3. **Start the product**

    Start the product using the following command:

    If you are using a Linux or macOS machine:

    ```bash
    bash start.sh
    ```

    If you are using a Windows machine:

    ```powershell
    .\start.ps1
    ```

#### Option 2: Run with Docker

Follow these steps to run WSO2 Thunder using Docker.

1. **Pull the Docker image**

    ```bash
    docker pull ghcr.io/asgardeo/thunder:latest

      -p 8090:8090 \
      ghcr.io/asgardeo/thunder:latest
    ```

    Optionally if you want to modify the server configurations, you can mount a custom `deployment.yaml` file. Create a `deployment.yaml` file in your working directory similar to the [deployment.yaml](https://github.com/asgardeo/thunder/blob/main/backend/cmd/server/repository/conf/deployment.yaml), and mount it as below:

    ```bash
    docker run --rm \
      -p 8090:8090 \
      -v $(pwd)/deployment.yaml:/opt/thunder/repository/conf/deployment.yaml \
      ghcr.io/asgardeo/thunder:latest
    ```

    Optionally if you want to use custom configurations or certificates, you can mount them as follows:

    ```bash
    docker run --rm \
      -p 8090:8090 \
      -v $(pwd)/deployment.yaml:/opt/thunder/repository/conf/deployment.yaml \
      -v $(pwd)/certs/server.cert:/opt/thunder/repository/resources/security/server.cert \
      -v $(pwd)/certs/server.key:/opt/thunder/repository/resources/security/server.key \
      ghcr.io/asgardeo/thunder:latest

#### Try Out Client Credentials Flow

The Client Credentials flow is used to obtain an access token for machine-to-machine communication. This flow does not require user interaction and is typically used for server-to-server communication.

To try out the Client Credentials flow, follow these steps:

1. Create a Client Application

   Create a client application in the system to use for the Client Credentials flow. You can use the following cURL command to create a new application.

    ```bash
    curl -kL -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' https://localhost:8090/applications \
    -d '{
        "name": "Test Sample App",
        "description": "Initial testing App",
        "auth_flow_graph_id": "auth_flow_config_basic",
        "inbound_auth_config": [
            {
                "type": "oauth2",
                "config": {
                    "client_id": "<client_id>",
                    "client_secret": "<client_secret>",
                    "redirect_uris": [
                        "https://localhost:3000"
                    ],
                    "grant_types": [
                        "client_credentials"
                    ],
                    "token_endpoint_auth_method": "client_secret_basic",
                    "pkce_required": false,
                    "public_client": false,
                    "scopes": ["api:read", "api:write"]
                }
            }
        ]
    }'
    ```

2. Obtain an Access Token

   Use the following cURL command to obtain an access token using the Client Credentials flow. Make sure to replace the `<client_id>` and `<client_secret>` with the values you used when creating the client application.

    ```bash
    curl -k -X POST https://localhost:8090/oauth2/token \
      -d 'grant_type=client_credentials' \
      -u '<client_id>:<client_secret>'
    ```

      "expires_in": 3600
    }
    ```

</details>
<details>
<summary><h4>Authorization Code Flow</h4></summary>

<p>The Authorization Code flow is used to obtain an access token after the user authenticates. This flow is typically used for web applications where a user redirection is required to complete the authentication process.</p>

1. **Configure a Gate Client**

    Authorization code flow requires you to setup a gate client to handle the login and error redirection. You can implement your own client following the [sample gate client implementation](./frontend/apps/gate/).
  
    Add the following configurations to the `deployment.yaml` file to configure the gate client.

    ```yaml
    gate_client:
      hostname: "localhost"
      port: 9090
      scheme: "https"
      login_path: "/login"
      error_path: "/error"
    ```

    Make sure to restart the server after making this change.

2. **Create a Client Application**

    Create a client application in the system to use for the Authorization Code flow. You can use the following cURL command to create a new application.

    ```bash
    curl -kL -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' https://localhost:8090/applications \
    -d '{
        "name": "Test Sample App",

                }
            }
        ]
    }'
    ```

3. **Create a User**

    Create a user in the system if you haven't already. First, create an organization unit, then create a user with the required attributes.

    ```bash
    curl -kL -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' https://localhost:8090/organization-units \
    -d '{
        "name": "Asgard",
        "description": "Realm of the gods",
        "handle": "asgard"
    }'
    ```

    Note the `id` from the response above, then use it in the user creation:

    ```bash
    curl -kL -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://localhost:8090/users \
    -d '{
        "organizationUnit": "{ou-id-from-above}",

    ```

4. **Start the Authorization Code Flow**

    - Open the following URL in your browser to start the authorization code flow. Make sure to replace `<client_id>` with the client ID of the application you created in the previous step.

        ```bash
        https://localhost:8090/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=<client_id>&redirect_uri=https://localhost:3000&scope=openid&state=state_1
        ```

    - You will be redirected to the login page of the gate client. If you have configured a custom gate client, you will see the login page of that client.

    - Enter the credentials of the user you created in the first step.

    - After successful authentication, you will be redirected to the redirect URI with the authorization code and state.

        ```bash
        https://localhost:3000/?code=<code>&state=state_1
        ```

    - Copy the authorization code and exchange it for an access token using the following cURL command:

        ```bash
        curl -k -X POST 'https://localhost:8090/oauth2/token' \
        -u '<client_id>:<client_secret>' \
        -d 'grant_type=authorization_code' \
        -d 'redirect_uri=https://localhost:3000' \
        -d 'code=<code>'
        ```

    - If the request is successful, you will receive a response containing the access token:

        ```json
        {
          "access_token": "<access_token>",
          "token_type": "Bearer",
          "expires_in": 3600,
        }
        ```

<details>
<summary><h4>Refresh Token Flow</h4></summary>

<p>The Refresh Token flow is used to obtain a new access token using a refresh token. This flow is typically used when the access token has expired and the user does not need to re-authenticate.</p>

<p>Refresh token flow can only be try out with the Authorization Code flow. To try out the Refresh Token flow, follow these steps:</p>

1. **Create a Client Application**

    Create a client application in the system to use for the Refresh Token flow. You can use the following cURL command to create a new application.

    ```bash
    curl -kL -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' https://localhost:8090/applications \
    -d '{
        "name": "Test Sample App",
        "description": "Initial testing App",
        "auth_flow_graph_id": "auth_flow_config_basic",
        "inbound_auth_config": [
            {
                "type": "oauth2",

                    "client_id": "<client_id>",
                    "client_secret": "<client_secret>",
                    "redirect_uris": [
                        "https://localhost:3000"
                    ],
                    "grant_types": [
                        "authorization_code", "refresh_token"
                    ],
                    "response_types": [
                        "code"
                    ],
                    "token_endpoint_auth_method": "client_secret_basic",
                    "pkce_required": false,
                    "public_client": false,
                    "scopes": ["openid", "profile", "email"]
                }
            }
        ]
    }'
    ```

2. **Start the Authorization Code Flow**

    Follow the steps in the [Authorization Code Flow](#authorization-code-flow) section to obtain an access token and a refresh token.

    After successful authentication, you will receive a response containing the access token and the refresh token:

    ```json
    {
      "access_token": "<access_token>",
      "token_type": "Bearer",
      "expires_in": 3600,
      "refresh_token": "<refresh_token>"
    }
    ```

3. **Obtain a New Access Token Using the Refresh Token**

    Use the following cURL command to obtain a new access token using the refresh token. Make sure to replace `<client_id>`, `<client_secret>`, and `<refresh_token>` with the values you used when creating the client application and the refresh token you received in the previous step.

    ```bash
    curl -k -X POST 'https://localhost:8090/oauth2/token' \
    -u '<client_id>:<client_secret>' \
    -d 'grant_type=refresh_token' \
    -d 'refresh_token=<refresh_token>'
    ```

    If the request is successful, you will receive a response containing the new access token:

    ```json
    {
      "access_token": "<new_access_token>",
      "token_type": "Bearer",
      "expires_in": 3600,
      "refresh_token": "<new_refresh_token>"
    }

    }'
    ```



5. **Create a User with Mobile Number**

    Create a user in the system with a mobile number attribute to receive SMS OTP. First, create an organization unit, then create a user with the required attributes.

    ```bash
    curl -kL -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' https://localhost:8090/organization-units \
    -d '{
        "name": "Asgard",
        "description": "Realm of the gods",
        "handle": "asgard"
    }'
    ```

    Note the `id` from the response above, then use it in the user creation:

    ```bash
    curl -kL -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://localhost:8090/users \
    -d '{
        "organizationUnit": "{ou-id-from-above}",
        "type": "superhuman",
        "attributes": {
            "username": "thor",

        "flowType": "AUTHENTICATION"
    }'
    ```

    You'll receive a response prompting for username input.

7. **Continue the Login Flow**

    Provide the username to continue the flow:

    ```bash
    curl -kL -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://localhost:8090/flow/execute \
    -d '{
        "flowId": "<flow_id>",
        "inputs": {
            "username": "thor"
        }
    }'
    ```

    An OTP will be sent to the user's mobile number.

        "auth_flow_graph_id": "auth_flow_config_sms",
        "registration_flow_graph_id": "registration_flow_config_sms",
        "is_registration_flow_enabled": true
    }'
    ```



5. **Start the Registration Flow**

    Start registration flow for the application with the following cURL command:

    ```bash
    curl -kL -H 'Accept: application/json' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://localhost:8090/flow/execute \
    -d '{
        "applicationId": "<application_id>",
        "flowType": "REGISTRATION"
    }'
    ```

    You'll receive a response similar to the following:

    ```json
    {
        "flowId": "db93a19e-c23f-4cfc-a45f-0e0bc157f6d5",
        "flowStatus": "PROMPT_ONLY",
        "type": "VIEW",
        "data": {
        "inputs": [
            {
                "name": "mobileNumber",
                "type": "string",
                "required": true
            }
        ]
        }
    }
    ```

6. **Continue the Registration Flow**

    Make the second cURL request to continue the registration flow. Make sure to replace `<flow_id>` with the `flowId` received in the previous response. Also, replace the `mobileNumber` with the desired mobile number for the new user.

    ```bash
    curl -kL -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://localhost:8090/flow/execute \
    -d '{
        "flowId": "<flow_id>",
        "inputs": {
            "mobileNumber": "+94xxxxxxxxx"
        }
    }'
    ```

    An OTP will be sent to the provided mobile number.

7. **Verify the Mobile Number with OTP**

    Continue the registration by providing the OTP received on the mobile number:

    ```bash
    curl -kL -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://localhost:8090/flow/execute \
    -d '{
        "flowId": "<flow_id>",
        "inputs": {
            "otp": "696546"
        }
    }'
    ```

    If the verification is successful, you will receive a response prompting for additional user attributes.

    ```json
    {
        "flowId": "db93a19e-c23f-4cfc-a45f-0e0bc157f6d5",
        "flowStatus": "PROMPT_ONLY",
        "type": "VIEW",
        "data": {
        "inputs": [
            {
                "name": "email",
                "type": "string",
                "required": true
            },
            {
                "name": "firstName",
                "type": "string",
                "required": true
            },
            {
                "name": "lastName",
                "type": "string",
                "required": true
            }
        ]
        }
    }
    ```

8. **Complete the Registration Flow**

    Make the third cURL request to complete the registration flow. Make sure to replace `<flow_id>` with the `flowId` received in the previous response.

    ```bash
    curl -kL -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://localhost:8090/flow/execute \
    -d '{
        "flowId": "<flow_id>",
        "inputs": {
            "email": "thor@thunder.sky",
            "firstName": "Thor",
            "lastName": "Odinson"
        }
    }'
    ```

    If the registration is successful, you will receive a response with the auth assertion.

<summary><h3>Individual Authentication APIs</h3></summary>

</br><p>Thunder provides standalone authentication APIs that can be used independently without the flow orchestration. These APIs are useful for simple authentication scenarios or when you want to build custom authentication flows in your application.</p>

<details>
<summary><h4>Credentials Authentication</h4></summary>

<p>The credentials authentication API allows you to authenticate users by providing any user identifying attribute (such as username, email, or mobile number) along with any credentials attribute (such as password or PIN).</p>

1. **Create a User**

    First, create an organization unit and a user with the desired identifying and credentials attributes:

    ```bash
    curl -kL -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' https://localhost:8090/organization-units \
    -d '{
        "name": "Asgard",
        "description": "Realm of the gods",
        "handle": "asgard"
    }'
    ```

    Note the `id` from the response above, then use it to create a user:

    ```bash
    curl -kL -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://localhost:8090/users \
    -d '{
        "organizationUnit": "{ou-id-from-above}",
        "type": "superhuman",
        "attributes": {
            "username": "thor",
            "password": "<password>",
            "email": "thor@thunder.sky",
            "given_name": "Thor",
            "family_name": "Odinson"
        }
    }'
    ```

2. **Authenticate with Credentials**

    Use the credentials authentication API to authenticate the user. You can provide any user identifying attribute along with any credentials attribute.

    ```bash
    curl -kL -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' https://localhost:8090/auth/credentials/authenticate \
    -d '{
        "username": "thor",
        "password": "<password>"
    }'
    ```

    If authentication is successful, you'll receive a response with the user details and an assertion token:

    ```json
    {
        "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
        "type": "superhuman",
        "organization_unit": "660e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
        "assertion": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
    }
    ```

    **For step-up authentication**, you can pass an existing assertion token to enrich it with credentials authentication:

    ```bash
    curl -kL -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' https://localhost:8090/auth/credentials/authenticate \
    -d '{
        "username": "thor",
        "password": "<password>",
        "assertion": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
    }'
    ```

    If authentication is successful, you'll receive a response with the user details and an assertion token (enriched with credentials authentication if an existing assertion was provided):

    ```json
    {
        "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
        "type": "superhuman",
        "organization_unit": "660e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
        "assertion": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
    }
    ```

    {
        "status": "SUCCESS",
        "session_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
    }
    ```

4. **Verify SMS OTP**

    Verify the OTP received by the user:

    ```bash
    curl -kL -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' https://localhost:8090/auth/otp/sms/verify \
    -d '{
        "session_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
        "otp": "123456"
    }'
    ```

    **For step-up authentication**, you can pass an existing assertion token to enrich it with OTP authentication:

    ```bash
    curl -kL -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' https://localhost:8090/auth/otp/sms/verify \
    -d '{

    > Note: Refer [Identity Provider Configuration Guide](/docs/content/configure-identity-providers.md) for more details on configuring identity providers.

3. **Start Standard OAuth Authentication**

    Initiate the OAuth flow:

    ```bash
    curl -kL -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' https://localhost:8090/auth/oauth/standard/start \
    -d '{
        "idp_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
    }'
    ```

    You'll receive a response with the redirect URL and session token:

    ```json
    {
        "redirect_url": "https://provider.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=...",
        "session_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
    }
    ```

4. **Complete Standard OAuth Authentication**

    After the user authenticates with the identity provider and is redirected back, complete the authentication:

    ```bash
    curl -kL -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' https://localhost:8090/auth/oauth/standard/finish \
    -d '{
        "session_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
        "code": "<authorization_code_from_provider>"
    }'
    ```

    **For step-up authentication**, you can pass an existing assertion token to enrich it with OAuth authentication:

    ```bash
    curl -kL -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' https://localhost:8090/auth/oauth/standard/finish \
    -d '{
        "session_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
        "code": "<authorization_code_from_provider>",
        "assertion": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
    }'
    ```

    If authentication is successful, you'll receive a response with the user details and an assertion token (enriched with OAuth IDP authentication if an existing assertion was provided):

    ```json
    {
        "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
        "type": "superhuman",
        "organization_unit": "660e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
        "assertion": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
    }
    ```

<summary><h4>Working with Assertion Tokens and Step-Up Authentication</h4></summary>

<h5>Assertion Tokens</h5>

<p>When you successfully authenticate using the individual authentication APIs, Thunder returns an <strong>assertion token</strong> (JWT) in the response. This token contains authentication assurance information including:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Authentication methods used</strong> - Which authentication mechanisms were completed (e.g., password, OTP, social login)</li>
  <li><strong>Assurance level</strong> - The strength/confidence level of the authentication</li>
  <li><strong>User identity</strong> - Information about the authenticated user</li>
</ul>

<p>You can control whether the assertion token is returned by using the <code>skip_assertion</code> parameter in your API requests:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>skip_assertion: false</code> (default) - The API returns the assertion token in the response</li>
  <li><code>skip_assertion: true</code> - The API skips generating and returning the assertion token</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

```bash
curl -kL -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' https://localhost:8090/auth/credentials/authenticate \
-d '{
    "username": "thor",
    "password": "<password>",
    "skip_assertion": true
}'
```

<h5>Step-Up Authentication</h5>

<p>Thunder supports <strong>step-up authentication</strong>, allowing you to progressively increase the authentication assurance level by combining multiple authentication methods. This is particularly useful for scenarios requiring stronger authentication for sensitive operations.</p>

<p>To perform step-up authentication, pass an existing <code>assertion</code> token when calling supported authentication APIs. The API will enrich the existing assertion with the new authentication method, creating a stronger authentication context.</p>

<p><strong>Supported APIs for step-up authentication:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Credentials Authentication (<code>/auth/credentials/authenticate</code>)</li>
  <li>SMS OTP Verification (<code>/auth/otp/sms/verify</code>)</li>
  <li>Google OAuth (<code>/auth/oauth/google/finish</code>)</li>
  <li>GitHub OAuth (<code>/auth/oauth/github/finish</code>)</li>
  <li>Standard OAuth (<code>/auth/oauth/standard/finish</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example step-up authentication flow:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>User authenticates with username/password → receives assertion token A</li>
  <li>For a sensitive operation, require additional authentication via SMS OTP</li>
  <li>Pass assertion token A when verifying OTP → receive enhanced assertion token B</li>
  <li>Assertion token B now contains both password and OTP authentication assurance</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Example request with step-up authentication:</strong></p>

```bash
curl -kL -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' https://localhost:8090/auth/otp/sms/verify \
-d '{
    "session_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
    "otp": "123456",
    "assertion": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
}'
```
